# Deep Reinforcement Learning Autoencoder for Noisy Feedback Communication

## Project Overview

This project implements the concepts from the paper **"Deep Reinforcement Learning Autoencoder with Noisy Feedback"** by Mathieu Goutay, Fay√ßal Ait Aoudia, and Jakob Hoydis. The goal is to develop an end-to-end communication system that utilizes deep reinforcement learning (RL) and autoencoders to optimize performance over noisy channels.

### Inspiration

This implementation is inspired by various GitHub repositories focusing on deep learning and communication systems, which provided valuable insights into the application of machine learning techniques in real-world scenarios.

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Learning**: Utilizes deep RL and autoencoders for joint optimization of transmitter and receiver.

- **Noisy Feedback Handling**: Implements a novel training method that operates effectively even with noisy feedback.

- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates the system on various channel models, including Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh block-fading channels.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (specify the version)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeepRL_Autoencoder.git
cd DeepRL_Autoencoder
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the implementation:

```bash
jupyter notebook code_colab.ipynb
```
