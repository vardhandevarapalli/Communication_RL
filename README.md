# Machine Learning Applications in Wireless Communications - Project work
Implementation and experiments related to model proposed in the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.05419.pdf

The final code is in `code_colab.ipynb`.

All the implementations are done in Google Colab with Tensorflow 1.13 as the backend, so we insist to run them on https://colab.research.google.com/ to prevent any issues with dependencies.

All the documentation and explanation for each code snippet has been done in the ipython notebook itself. A PDF version of the same will be attached for a quicker look at the same
